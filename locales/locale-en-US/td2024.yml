    t: |
      [TokyoDev](https://tokyodev.com) helps international developers start and grow their careers in Japan.

      One way we do this is through conducting an annual survey of international developers already living here, and in this sixth edition, 814 developers told us about their salary, working conditions, and technology used. Based on this, here are some of the most interesting findings:

  - key: takeaways.median_compensation_2024
    t: |
      The median compensation of respondents was [¥8.5 million](/en-US/current-job/#current_total_annual_compensation) per year, the same as [last year’s survey](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/compensation/). This is down from ¥9.5 million in 2022.

  - key: takeaways.gender_2024
    t: |
      The median compensation of male respondents was [46% higher](/en-US/demographics/#gender) than that of female respondents. Even when accounting for professional experience, male respondents continued to make more, and the disparity in pay actually grew with seniority.

  - key: takeaways.language_2024
    t: |
      [94% of respondents](/en-US/demographics/#language_proficiency_english) were comfortable using English in a professional setting, and a higher English ability correlated with higher compensation. Conversely, only [40% of respondents](/en-US/demographics/#language_proficiency_japanese) were comfortable using Japanese in a professional setting, and Japanese ability had little correlation with compensation.

  - key: takeaways.employer_2024
    t: |
      As in previous years, we observed that those working at internationally-headquartered companies made significantly more than those at Japanese-headquartered companies. Employees of international companies made a median of [47% more](/en-US/current-job/#current_employer) than employees of Japanese companies. This gap was larger in 2023, when employees of international companies made [73% more](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/employer-info/#current_employer).

  - key: takeaways.gaming_2024
    t: |
      The [gaming industry](/en-US/current-job/#industry_sector) had the lowest compensation and highest percentage of respondents who always used Japanese with their colleagues.

  - key: takeaways.hours_per_week_2024
    t: |
      While Japan internationally has a reputation for poor work-life balance, that didn’t seem to be the case for most of our respondents. [70% reported enjoying a good work-life balance](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/work-environment/#workplace_perks), [72% worked at most 40 hours in a typical week](/en-US/work-environment/#work_hours_per_week), and [55% planned to use 80-100% of their paid leave](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/work-environment/#paid_leave_percentage).

  - key: takeaways.remote_work_2024
    t: |
      [Companies are switching](/en-US/work-environment/#remote_work_policy) from allowing employees to work remotely to a hybrid model requiring them to come into the office at least some of the time. While in 2023 43% of respondents could choose whether or not to come to the office, that number fell to 38% this year, with those subject to a hybrid policy increasing by a corresponding amount.

  - key: takeaways.training_2024
    t: |
      Employers could improve training and skill development. Only [14% of respondents](/en-US/work-environment/#workplace_perks) said that training was a positive aspect of their employer, the lowest among all aspects of the workplace that we surveyed.

  - key: takeaways.satisfaction_2024
    t: |
      Across [all measures of satisfaction](/en-US/satisfaction/), personal and professional, the more unhappy someone was, the more likely they were to be looking for a new job.

  - key: takeaways.favourite_thing_about_japan_2024
    t: |
      Respondents who had recently moved to Japan were more likely to rate food or culture as [their favourite thing about Japan](/en-US/other/#favourite_thing_about_japan), while those who had lived in Japan for longer were more likely to rate safety or peacefulness as their favourite thing.

  - key: sections.user_info.description
    t: This year, we collected data from 814 survey participants.

  - key: user_info.japan_province.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      80% of respondents lived in the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa).

      Respondents in Tokyo, Chiba, and Kanagawa had the highest median rating of social life satisifaction, while those in Osaka, Kyoto, and Hyogo had lowest median satisfaction.

  - key: user_info.reason_for_relocation.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Only 5% of respondents were born in Japan. 57% came to Japan via an employer, either after being hired by a Japanese company or transferred by an existing one.

      Despite the working holiday visa program being limited to residents of certain countries under a certain age, 7% of respondents came on it.

  - key: user_info.residency_status.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      59% of respondents had a residency status tied to their employer (engineer or highly skilled foreign professional).

  - key: user_info.country.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      The respondents were quite diverse, holding citizenships from 73 countries or regions.

  - key: user_info.age.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      81% of respondents were between 20 and 39 years old. The median age was 33.

  - key: user_info.gender.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Male respondents had more experience than female respondents. While men had a median of 7 years of professional experience, women had 6 years. Furthermore, men had a 75th percentile of 13 years of experience compared to 9 for women, indicating that significantly fewer women reach the most senior levels of experience.

      This partially explains why the median compensation of male respondents was 46% higher than women respondents. However, even when accounting for professional experience, male respondents continued to make more, and the disparity in pay grew with experience. While men with 4-6 years of experience made 7% more than women, men with 7-9 years of experience made 31% more.

      The reasons behind this disparity are complex, but it's clear that women face challenges in the Japanese tech industry. For ideas on concrete action your company can take on this, please see [this article](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/hiring-women-on-your-engineering-team).

  - key: user_info.years_of_experience.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      The median respondent had 7 years of professional software development experience, up from [6 years in 2023’s survey](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#years_of_experience).

      Respondents who had 1-3 years of experience made a median of ¥3.5 million, down from [¥5.7 million in 2023](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#years_of_experience). The reason behind this drop is unclear.

  - key: user_info.total_employers.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Respondents typically changed jobs every two to three years. Those who had had a single employer had a median of 2 years of professional experience, those with two employers had a median of 5 years, and those with three employers had a median of 7 years.

  - key: user_info.years_in_japan.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Respondents lived in Japan for a median of 5 years.

      While respondents from India and Russia made up 11% of respondents overall, they made up 25% of those who had lived in Japan for less than a year.
  - key: user_info.professional_qualifications.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Although coding bootcamp grads made the least overall, when taking into account professional experience, they had higher compensation than those with a bachelor's degree.

  - key: user_info.language_proficiency_english.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      94% of respondents were comfortable using English in a professional setting. A higher English ability correlated with higher compensation.

  - key: user_info.language_proficiency_japanese.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Only 40% of respondents were comfortable using Japanese in a professional setting.

      Japanese ability had little correlation with compensation.

      Those with conversational Japanese had a median of 5 years living in Japan while those with fluent-level Japanese had a median of 9 years.

  - key: user_info.finding_first_job_number_of_applications.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      The number of applications a respondent sent out to get their first job in Japan had an inverse correlation with their years of professional experience, but no correlation with the time they've lived in Japan.

      While 45% of bootcamp graduates sent out more than 20 applications, only 14% of those with a Computer Science (or related) bachelor's degree did.

  - key: job_info.coworker_nationalities_non_engineers.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      When all of a respondent's non-engineer colleagues were non-Japanese, 97% worked on an engineering team where all their colleagues were non-Japanese. The reverse wasn't true though. When all of a respondent's non-engineer colleagues were Japanese, only 29% worked on an engineering team where all their colleagues were Japanese.

  - key: job_info.languages_used_colleagues_japanese.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Given that only 40% of respondents said they spoke Japanese at a professional level, it's not surprising that only 32% of respondents said they frequently or always used Japanese with their colleagues.

  - key: job_info.languages_used_colleagues_english.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Respondents who frequently or always used English had the highest compensation, with a median of ¥9.5 million. Those who never used or rarely used English had the lowest compensation, with a median of ¥5.5 million. These respondents also had the lowest median years of professional experience.

    t: |
      Those who were not looking for a job reported aspects of their workplace as being positive at a much higher rate than those who were actively looking. For instance, while 82% of respondents who were not looking for a job said they were satisfied with their working conditions, only 48% of those who were looking for a job said the same.

  - key: job_info.workplace_difficulties.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Those who had to attend an office were more negative about their workplace than those who could work fully remotely on every aspect we surveyed except job security. Company culture was especially negative for those who could not work remotely, with 53% saying it was a negative aspect of their job, compared to 16% of those who worked in a fully remotely environment.

  - key: employer_info.current_employer.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Internationally headquartered companies paid better than Japanese ones. Those working for an international employer made a median of 47% more than those working for a Japanese employer.

      The difference is negligible among inexperienced respondents. However, those with 10-20 years of experience who are working for an international company have a median compensation that is at least 75% higher than those at a domestic company.

  - key: employer_info.industry_sector.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
