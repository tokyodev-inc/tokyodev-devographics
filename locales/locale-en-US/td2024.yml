      [TokyoDev](https://tokyodev.com) helps international developers start and grow their career in Japan.

      One way we do this is through conducting an annual survey of international developers already living here, and in this sixth edition, 814 developers told us about their salary, working conditions, and technology used. Based on this, here's some of the most interesting findings:

  - key: takeaways.median_compensation_2024
    t: |
      The median total compensation of respondents was [¥8.5 million](/en-US/compensation/#current_total_annual_compensation), the same as [last year's median](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/compensation/). 10% of respondents made ¥20 million or more.

  - key: takeaways.gender_2024
    t: |
      The median compensation of male respondents was [46% higher](/en-US/demographics/#gender) than women respondents. Even when accounting for professional experience, male respondents continued to make more, and the disparity in pay grew with experience.

  - key: takeaways.language_2024
    t: |
      [94% of respondents](/en-US/demographics/#language_proficiency_english) were comfortable using English in a professional setting, and a higher English ability correlated with higher compensation. Conversely, only [40% of respondents](/en-US/demographics/#language_proficiency_japanese) were comfortable using Japanese in a professional setting, and Japanese ability had little correlation with compensation.

  - key: takeaways.employer_2024
    t: |
      Internationally headquartered companies paid better than Japanese ones. Those working for an international employer made a median of [50% more](/en-US/demographics/#current_employer) than those working for a Japanese employer.

  - key: takeaways.gaming_2024
    t: |
      The [gaming industry](/en-US/demographics/#industry_sector) had the lowest compensation and highest percentage of respondents who always used Japanese with their colleagues.

  - key: takeaways.hours_per_week_2024
    t: |
      [72% of respondents](/en-US/demographics/#work_hours_per_week) regularly worked 40 hours or less per week.

  - key: takeaways.remote_work_2024
    t: |
      [Companies are switching](/en-US/demographics/#remote_work_policy) from allowing employees to work remotely to a hybrid model requiring them to come into the office some of the time. The less a respondent could work remotely, the more likely they were to be [looking for a job](/en-US/other/#searching_for_job), and the more [workplace difficulties](/en-US/work-environment/#workplace_difficulties) they encountered.

  - key: takeaways.training_2024
    t: |
      Employers could improve training and skill development. Only [14% of respondents](/en-US/work-environment/#workplace_perks) said that training was a positive aspect of their employer, the lowest among all aspects of the workplace that we surveyed.

  - key: takeaways.satisfaction_2024
    t: |
      Across [all measures of satisfaction](/en-US/satisfaction/), personal and professional, the more unhappy someone was, the more likely they were to be looking for a new job.

  - key: takeaways.favourite_thing_about_japan_2024
    t: |
      Respondents who had recently moved to Japan were more likely to rate food or culture as [their favourite thing about Japan](/en-US/other/#favourite_thing_about_japan), while those who had lived in Japan for longer were more likely to rate safety or peacefulness as their favourite thing.

  - key: sections.user_info.description
    t: This year, we collected data from 814 survey participants.

  - key: user_info.japan_province.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      80% of respondents lived in the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa).

      Respondents in Tokyo, Chiba, and Kanagawa had the highest median rating of social life satisifaction, while those in Osaka, Kyoto, and Hyogo had lowest median satisfaction.

  - key: user_info.reason_for_relocation.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Only 5% of respondents were born in Japan. 57% came to Japan via an employer, either after being hired by a Japanese company or transferred by an existing one.

      Despite the working holiday visa program being limited to residents of certain countries under a certain age, 7% of respondents came on it.

  - key: user_info.residency_status.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      59% of respondents had a residency status tied to their employer (engineer or highly skilled foreign professional).

  - key: user_info.country.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      The respondents were quite diverse, holding citizenships from 73 countries or regions.

  - key: user_info.age.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      81% of respondents were between 20 and 39 years old. The median age was 33.

  - key: user_info.gender.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Male respondents had more experience than female respondents. While men had a median of 7 years of professional experience, women had 6 years. Furthermore, men had a 75th percentile of 13 years of experience compared to 9 for women, indicating that significantly fewer women reach the most senior levels of experience.

      This partially explains why the median compensation of male respondents was 46% higher than women respondents. However, even when accounting for professional experience, male respondents continued to make more, and the disparity in pay grew with experience. While men with 4-6 years of experience made 7% more than women, men with 7-9 years of experience made 31% more.

      The reasons behind this disparity are complex, but it's clear that women face challenges in the Japanese tech industry. For ideas on concrete action your company can take on this, please see [this article](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/hiring-women-on-your-engineering-team).

  - key: user_info.years_of_experience.takeaway.td2024

  - key: user_info.total_employers.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Respondents typically changed jobs every two to three years. Those who had had a single employer had a median of 2 years of professional experience, those with two employers had a median of 5 years, and those with three employers had a median of 7 years.

  - key: user_info.years_in_japan.takeaway.td2024
    t: |

  - key: user_info.professional_qualifications.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Although coding bootcamp grads made the least overall, when taking into account professional experience, they had higher compensation than those with a bachelor's degree.

  - key: user_info.language_proficiency_english.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      94% of respondents were comfortable using English in a professional setting. A higher English ability correlated with higher compensation.

  - key: user_info.language_proficiency_japanese.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Only 40% of respondents were comfortable using Japanese in a professional setting.

      Japanese ability had little correlation with compensation.

      Those with conversational Japanese had a median of 5 years living in Japan while those with fluent-level Japanese had a median of 9 years.

  - key: user_info.finding_first_job_number_of_applications.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      The number of applications a respondent sent out to get their first job in Japan had an inverse correlation with their years of professional experience, but no correlation with the time they've lived in Japan.

      While 45% of bootcamp graduates sent out more than 20 applications, only 14% of those with a bachelor's degree did.

  - key: job_info.coworker_nationalities_non_engineers.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      When all of a respondent's non-engineer colleagues were non-Japanese, 97% worked on an engineering team where all their colleagues were non-Japanese. The reverse wasn't true though. When all of a respondent's non-engineer colleagues were Japanese, only 29% worked on an engineering team where all their colleagues were Japanese.

  - key: job_info.languages_used_colleagues_japanese.takeaway.td2024
    t: |

      Those who were not looking for a job reported aspects of their workplace as being positive at a much higher rate than those who were actively looking. For instance, while 82% of respondents who were not looking for a job said they were satisfied with their working conditions, only 48% of those who were looking for a job said the same.

  - key: job_info.workplace_difficulties.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Those who had to attend an office were more negative about their workplace than those who could work fully remotely on every aspect we surveyed except job security. Company culture was especially negative for those who could not work remotely, with 53% saying it was a negative aspect of their job, compared to 16% of those who worked in a fully remotely environment.

  - key: employer_info.current_employer.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Internationally headquartered companies paid better than Japanese ones. Those working for an international employer made a median of 50% more than those working for a Japanese employer.
