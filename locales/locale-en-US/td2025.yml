    t: >
      The community of international developers in Japan is small, so every response counts. Last year 814 developers filled it out. This year we’re aiming for 1,000 so we can unlock new insights while still protecting the anonymity of everyone who participates.

      Unlike last year's survey, this year the question above let respondents select “None of the above” as an option instead of having to skip the question altogether.

      The year-over-year decline shown here is almost certainly due to this increase in total question participation, and not to any real-world trend.

      Ever wondered how much the average developer in Japan earns? How common remote work really is? Or what people love most about living here?

      For the past seven years, we’ve been running the TokyoDev Developer Survey to answer these questions and many more. Last year, [over 800 developers took part](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/), and this year we’re expanding the survey with a section on AI to see how widespread its use really is, along with new questions about life in Japan.

      The survey is anonymous, and we’ll only share aggregated results, never personal data. The more responses we get, the better the insights, so please take a few minutes to answer the survey and share it with your peers.

      Welcome to the 2025 TokyoDev survey! It should take about 10 minutes to complete.

      Note: if a question is not applicable to your current situation, just click the **skip** button.

  - key: user_info.japan_province.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      78% of respondents lived in the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa), [down 2%](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#japan_province) from last year.

      Respondents in Aichi and Kyoto had a median compensation of ¥4.5 million, which was approximately half of the median compensation of those living in the Greater Tokyo Area.
  - key: user_info.residency_status.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      60% of respondents had a residency status tied to their employer (engineer or highly skilled foreign professional).
  - key: user_info.country.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      The respondents were quite diverse, holding citizenships from 81 countries or regions.
  - key: user_info.age.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      80% of respondents were between 20 and 39 years old.
  - key: user_info.relationship_status.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      73% of respondents were in some sort of relationship.
  - key: user_info.number_of_kids.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      While 71% of respondents had no children, among those who were married that dropped to 47%.
  - key: user_info.gender.takeaway.td2026
    t: |
      Male respondents had more experience than female respondents. While men had a median of 8 years of professional experience, women had 6 years. Furthermore, men had a 75th percentile of 12 years of experience compared to 9 for women.

      This partially explains why the median compensation of male respondents was 27% higher than women respondents. Among respondents who have less than seven years of experience, women actually had a median compensation that was ¥1 million higher than men. However, among those with 7-9 years experience, men earned ¥2.5 million more than women, and among those with 10 or more years of experience, men earned ¥5 million more.

      The reasons behind this disparity are complex, but it's clear that women face challenges in the Japanese tech industry. For ideas on concrete action your company can take on this, please see [this article](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/hiring-women-on-your-engineering-team).
  - key: user_info.years_of_experience.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      The median respondent had 7 years of professional software development experience.

      Compensation grew steadily with experience, with respondents with less than one year of experience making a median of ¥2.8 million while those with 20+ years of experience made a median of ¥14.6 million.
  - key: user_info.professional_qualifications.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      74% of respondents had a bachelor's degree or higher related to computer science.
  - key: user_info.language_proficiency_english.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      96% of respondents were comfortable using English in a professional setting.
  - key: user_info.language_proficiency_japanese.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      42% of respondents were comfortable using Japanese in a professional setting.

  # job_info

  - key: job_info.employment_status.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Company directors had the highest median pay at ¥16 million, while temporary workers had the lowest at ¥5.5 million.

      Directors were also most likely to be native or bilingual English speakers, with 82% compared to 36% of temporary workers.
  - key: job_info.job_title.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Those with an Engineering Manager or Manager job title made a median of ¥12.5 million. Those with a Senior Engineer title made ¥10.5 million, while Software Engineers made ¥8.5 million. System Engineers had the lowest compensation, making a median of ¥3.5 million.
  - key: job_info.current_employer.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Those working for a Japanese subsidiary of an international company made 35% more than those working for a Japanese headquartered company. The difference in pay continues to trend down, from a peak of [93% more in 2023](https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2022-developer-survey#employer-type), [73% more in 2023](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/employer-info/#current_employer), and [47% more in 2024](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#current_employer). This trend has been driven by respondents at subsidiaries having a lower median compensation while that of respondents at Japanese headquartered companies remains stable.
  - key: job_info.languages_used_colleagues_english.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Respondents who always used English had the highest compensation, with a median of ¥10.5 million. They were also the least likely to work for a Japanese headquartered company.
  - key: job_info.languages_used_colleagues_japanese.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      83% of respondents who always used Japanese worked for a company headquartered in Japan, whereas only 41% of respondents who never used it worked for one.
  - key: job_info.work_hours_per_week.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      32% of respondents who worked 50+ hours were looking for a new job, whereas only 16% overall were.
  - key: job_info.regular_work_location.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      45% of respondents who could choose whether to work fully remotely or not still chose to regularly go into the office.
  - key: job_info.searching_for_job.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      37% of respondents who could not work remotely were looking for a job — at least twice the rate of those with hybrid or fully remote policies. While job seekers had a median of six years of experience compared to eight for others, experience did not appear to be a major factor. Even among respondents with the same level of experience, those unable to work remotely were still much more likely to be job hunting.
  - key: job_info.discrimination_issues.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      While 31% of women reported they had been discriminated on the basis of gender or gender identity, only 2% of men did.

      The median total compensation of those who were discriminated on the basis of political beliefs or affiliations was ¥18.5 million, double the overall median.
  - key: job_info.job_happiness.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Only 16% of respondents felt negatively about their current job.

      Less than 1% of respondents who were very happy with their job were looking for a new one. This percentage increased the less happy respondents were, with 61% of respondents who were very unhappy actively searching for a new one.
  - key: job_info.industry_sector.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      The manufacturing and consulting & services industries had the lowest compensation, with respondents making a median of ¥7.5 million. They were also the industries where respondents were most likely to use Japanese exclusively.
  - key: job_info.meeting_hours_per_week.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Longer meeting hours were correlated with more professional experience. Respondents who said they never had meetings had a median of 3.6 years of experience, whereas those who had 15 hours or more of them had a median of 13 years.
  - key: job_info.remote_work_policy.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Companies are continuing to move away from letting employees choose whether to work remotely. Last year, 38% of respondents could decide for themselves; this year, that fell to 32%. Most of the shift appears to be toward hybrid work, which rose from 37% to 43%. This follows the same trend as the previous year.

      Respondents who were not allowed to work remotely had the lowest professional satisfaction.
  - key: job_info.company_size.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      While only 18% of respondents worked at a company with more than 10,000 employees, 44% of respondents making ¥20 million or more worked at such a company.
  - key: job_info.current_total_annual_compensation.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      The median total compensation of respondents was ¥9.5 million, up from ¥8.5 million [last year](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/compensation/#current_total_annual_compensation). 10% of respondents made ¥20 million or more.
  - key: job_info.income_evolution.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Only 6% of respondents reported that their income decreased over the last year. Those who reported a decrease tended to be more experienced, with a median of 10 years of professional experience compared to 7 years for others.

  # technology

  - key: technology.programming_languages.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Python took first place for the most popular language.

      While programming language choice correlated with total compensation, this seems largely explained by differences in experience. Swift users had the highest median pay at ¥13 million and a median of 10.5 years of experience, while Dart users had the lowest pay at ¥4.5 million and the least experience at 5 years.
  - key: technology.web_frameworks.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      React remained the most popular web framework.
  - key: technology.cloud_platforms.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      AWS remained the most popular cloud platform.
  - key: technology.software_engineering_practices.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Greater use of English correlated with higher adoption of software engineering best practices, even among those working at Japanese-headquartered companies.

      For example, 70% of respondents who used English frequently or always said their employer used continuous integration, compared to 45% who rarely or never did. Similarly, 63% of frequent English users worked at organizations with monitoring and logging, compared to 34% of infrequent users. For automated testing, the figures were 59% versus 28%, and for infrastructure as code, 49% versus 25%. The only practice more common among infrequent English users was waterfall development, used by 30% compared to 15% of frequent users.
  - key: technology.social_media.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Among respondents with native or bilingual Japanese ability, the most popular social media platform was Twitter/X, used by 57%, compared to 25% of native or bilingual English speakers. Conversely, Reddit was most popular among native English speakers, used by 55%, compared to 34% of native Japanese speakers.

      While most respondents found out about the survey through other means, among social media channels, Reddit and LinkedIn were [the most common sources](/en-US/metadata/#source).

  # ai_usage

  - key: ai_usage.ai_tools.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      86% of Devin users worked at Japan-headquartered companies, the highest share across employer types, while only 62% of Grok users did so, the lowest.
  - key: ai_usage.use_cases.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Code generation was the most frequent use case for AI tools.

      While summarization was only used by 47% of respondents overall, among those that had a leadership role (Engineering Manager, CTO, etc.) it was used by 74% of respondents.
  - key: ai_usage.ai_generated_code_balance.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      33% of respondents were generating at least half the code they produced through AI.
  - key: ai_usage.ai_generated_code_balance.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Hallucinations and code quality were the top concerns respondents had about AI tools, regardless of gender. However, women were significantly more concerned about broader societal issues. Ethical concerns were cited by 36% of women compared to 19% of men, privacy concerns by 32% of women compared to 21% of men, and environmental impact concerns by 28% of women compared to 18% of men.
  - key: ai_usage.job_security_threat.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Only 19% of respondents saw AI as a threat to their job security.
  - key: ai_usage.ai_code_generation_frequency.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Developers who used AI more frequently tended to have less experience: the median was 10 years for those who never used it, compared to 6 years for those who used it constantly.

  # life_in_japan

  - key: life_in_japan.friend_group_balance.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Higher Japanese ability was linked to having more Japanese friends. Among respondents with no Japanese ability, 91% said their friend group was all or mostly non-Japanese. For those with business or fluent Japanese ability, that figure dropped to 44%.
  - key: life_in_japan.hobbies.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Even outside of work, respondents spent much of their time in front of a screen. Their top three hobbies were playing video games, programming, and watching movies or TV.
  - key: life_in_japan.initial_attraction.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Responses to this question varied by nationality. For American citizens, the top reason was an interest in the Japanese language. For Indian citizens, it was career opportunities. For Japanese citizens, it was family.
  - key: life_in_japan.life_japan_positive_aspects.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Convenience ranked highly as a positive aspect of Japan across all nationalities. American and Japanese citizens were more likely to value Japan’s health care, while Indian citizens rated travel and adventure especially highly.
  - key: life_in_japan.life_japan_negative_aspects.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      The top negative aspect of life in Japan was the same across all nationalities: poor compensation. After that, non-Japanese citizens most often cited isolation and cultural barriers, while Japanese citizens were more likely to mention pressure to conform.
  - key: life_in_japan.communities.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Half of respondents said they weren’t active in any developer communities.

      Among those who were, members of TokyoDev’s Discord had a median compensation of ¥7.5 million, compared to ¥9.5 million for participants in TokyoDev’s in-person events. Discord members also had slightly less experience, with a median of 6 years compared to 7 years for offline participants.
