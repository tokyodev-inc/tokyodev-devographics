      The community of international developers in Japan is small, so every response counts. Last year 814 developers filled it out. This year we’re aiming for 1,000 so we can unlock new insights while still protecting the anonymity of everyone who participates.

      Unlike last year's survey, this year the question above let respondents select “None of the above” as an option instead of having to skip the question altogether.

      The year-over-year decline shown here is almost certainly due to this increase in total question participation, and not to any real-world trend.

      Ever wondered how much the average developer in Japan earns? How common remote work really is? Or what people love most about living here?

      For the past seven years, we’ve been running the TokyoDev Developer Survey to answer these questions and many more. Last year, [over 800 developers took part](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/), and this year we’re expanding the survey with a section on AI to see how widespread its use really is, along with new questions about life in Japan.

      The survey is anonymous, and we’ll only share aggregated results, never personal data. The more responses we get, the better the insights, so please take a few minutes to answer the survey and share it with your peers.

      Welcome to the 2025 TokyoDev survey! It should take about 10 minutes to complete.

      Note: if a question is not applicable to your current situation, just click the **skip** button.

  - key: user_info.japan_province.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      78% of respondents lived in the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa), [down 2%](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#japan_province) from last year.

      Respondents in Aichi and Kyoto had a median compensation of ¥4.5 million, which was approximately half of the median compensation of those living in the Greater Tokyo Area.
  - key: user_info.residency_status.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      60% of respondents had a residency status tied to their employment (engineer or highly skilled foreign professional).
  - key: user_info.country.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Survey respondents were quite diverse, hailing from 81 different countries or regions.
  - key: user_info.age.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      80% of respondents were between 20 and 39 years old.
  - key: user_info.relationship_status.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      73% of respondents were in some sort of relationship.
  - key: user_info.number_of_kids.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      While 71% of respondents had no children, among those who were married that number dropped to 47%.
  - key: user_info.gender.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Male respondents had more experience than female respondents. While men had a median of 8 years of professional experience, women had 6 years. Furthermore, men had a 75th percentile of 12 years of experience compared to 9 for women.

      This partially explains why the median compensation of male respondents was 27% higher than that of female respondents. For respondents with less than 7 years of experience, women actually had a median compensation that was ¥1 million higher than men's. However, among those with 7-9 years experience, men earned ¥2.5 million more than women, and among those with 10 or more years of experience, men earned ¥5 million more.

      The reasons behind this disparity are complex, but it's clear that women face challenges in the Japanese tech industry. For ideas on concrete action your company can take to help, please see [this article](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/hiring-women-on-your-engineering-team).
  - key: user_info.years_of_experience.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      The median respondent had 7 years of professional software development experience.

      Compensation grew steadily with experience. Respondents with less than 1 year of experience made a median of ¥2.8 million, while those with 20+ years of experience made a median of ¥14.6 million.
  - key: user_info.years_in_japan.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Respondents had lived in Japan for a median of 5 years.

      While respondents from India made up 7% of respondents overall, they made up 14% of those who had lived in Japan for less than a year.
  - key: user_info.professional_qualifications.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      74% of respondents had a bachelor's degree or higher related to computer science.
  - key: user_info.language_proficiency_english.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      96% of respondents were comfortable using English in a professional setting.
  - key: user_info.language_proficiency_japanese.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      42% of respondents were comfortable using Japanese in a professional setting.

  # job_info

  - key: job_info.employment_status.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Company directors had the highest median pay at ¥16 million, while temporary workers had the lowest at ¥5.5 million.

      Directors were also the most likely to be native or bilingual English speakers, at 82%, compared to 36% of temporary workers.
  - key: job_info.job_title.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Those with an Engineering Manager or Manager job title made a median of ¥12.5 million. Those with a Senior Engineer title made ¥10.5 million, while Software Engineers made ¥8.5 million. System Engineers had the lowest compensation, making a median of ¥3.5 million.
  - key: job_info.current_employer.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Those working for a Japanese subsidiary of an international company made 35% more than those working for a Japanese-headquartered company. The difference in pay continues to shrink, though, from a peak of [93% more in 2022](https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2022-developer-survey#employer-type) to [73% more in 2023](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/employer-info/#current_employer) to [47% more in 2024](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#current_employer). This trend has been driven by respondents at subsidiaries reporting lower median compensation, while the compensation for respondents at Japanese-headquartered companies has remained stable.
  - key: job_info.languages_used_colleagues_english.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Respondents who always used English had the highest compensation, with a median of ¥10.5 million. They were also the least likely to work for a Japanese-headquartered company.
  - key: job_info.languages_used_colleagues_japanese.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      83% of respondents who always used Japanese worked for a company headquartered in Japan, whereas only 41% of respondents who never used it worked for one.
  - key: job_info.work_hours_per_week.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      32% of respondents who worked 50+ hours were looking for a new job, whereas only 16% overall were.
  - key: job_info.regular_work_location.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      45% of respondents who could choose whether to work fully remotely or not still chose to go regularly into the office.
  - key: job_info.searching_for_job.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      42% of respondents who could not work remotely were looking for a job — at least twice the number of those with hybrid or fully remote workplaces. While job seekers had a median of 6 years of experience compared to 8 for others, experience did not appear to be a major factor. Even among respondents with the same level of experience, those unable to work remotely were still much more likely to be job hunting.
  - key: job_info.discrimination_issues.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      While 31% of women reported they had been discriminated against on the basis of gender or gender identity, only 2% of men did.

      The median total compensation of those who were discriminated against on the basis of political beliefs or affiliations was ¥18.5 million, double the overall median.
  - key: job_info.job_happiness.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Only 16% of respondents felt negatively about their current job.

      Less than 1% of respondents who were very happy with their job were looking for a new one. This percentage increased the less happy respondents were, with 61% of respondents who were very unhappy actively searching for a new role.
  - key: job_info.industry_sector.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      The manufacturing and consulting & services industries offered the lowest salaries, with respondents making a median of ¥7.5 million. They were also the industries in which respondents were most likely to use Japanese exclusively.
  - key: job_info.meeting_hours_per_week.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      More hours spent in meetings correlated with more professional experience. Respondents who said they never had meetings had a median of 3.6 years of experience, whereas those who reported 15 hours or more had a median of 13 years experience.
  - key: job_info.remote_work_policy.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Companies are continuing to move away from letting employees choose whether to work remotely. Last year, 38% of respondents could decide for themselves; this year, that fell to 32%. Most of the shift appears to be toward hybrid work, which rose from 37% to 43%, continuing last year's upward trend.

      Respondents who were not allowed to work remotely had the lowest professional satisfaction.
  - key: job_info.company_size.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      While only 18% of respondents worked at a company with more than 10,000 employees, 44% of respondents making ¥20 million or more worked at such a company.
  - key: job_info.current_total_annual_compensation.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      The median total compensation of respondents was ¥9.5 million, up from ¥8.5 million [last year](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#current_total_annual_compensation). 10% of respondents made ¥20 million or more.
  - key: job_info.income_evolution.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Only 6% of respondents reported that their income had decreased over the last year. Those who reported a decrease tended to be more experienced, with a median of 10 years of professional experience compared to 7 years for others.

  # technology

  - key: technology.programming_languages.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Python took first place for the most popular language.

      While programming language choice did correlate with total compensation, this seems largely explained by differences in experience. Swift users had the highest median pay at ¥13 million and a median of 10.5 years of experience, while Dart users had the lowest pay at ¥4.5 million and the least amount of experience at 5 years.
  - key: technology.web_frameworks.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      React remained the most popular web framework.
  - key: technology.cloud_platforms.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      AWS remained the most popular cloud platform.
  - key: technology.software_engineering_practices.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Greater use of English correlated with a higher adoption rate of software engineering best practices, even among those working at Japanese-headquartered companies.

      For example, 70% of respondents who used English frequently or always said their employer used continuous integration, compared to 45% who rarely or never did. Similarly, 63% of frequent English users worked at organizations with monitoring and logging, compared to 34% of infrequent users. For automated testing, the figures were 59% versus 28%, and for infrastructure as code, 49% versus 25%. The only practice more common among infrequent English users was waterfall development, used by 30% compared to 15% of frequent users.
  - key: technology.social_media.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Among respondents with native or bilingual Japanese ability, the most popular social media platform was Twitter/X, used by 57%, compared to 25% of native or bilingual English speakers. Conversely, Reddit was the most popular among native English speakers, used by 55%, compared to 34% of native Japanese speakers.

      Most respondents found out about the survey by other means, but if they did discover the survey through social media, Reddit and LinkedIn were [the most common sources](/en-US/metadata/#source).

  # ai_usage

  - key: ai_usage.ai_tools.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      94% of respondents used AI tools regularly. 86% of Devin users worked at Japanese-headquartered companies, the highest share across employer types, while only 62% of Grok users did so.
  - key: ai_usage.ai_uses.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Code generation was the most frequent use case for AI tools.

      While summarization was only used by 47% of respondents overall, among those that had a leadership role (Engineering Manager, CTO, etc.) it was used by 71% of respondents.
  - key: ai_usage.ai_generated_code_balance.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      33% of respondents were generating at least half the code they produced through AI.
  - key: ai_usage.ai_pain_points.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Hallucinations and code quality were the top concerns respondents had about AI tools, regardless of gender. However, women were significantly more worried about broader social issues. Ethical concerns were cited by 36% of women compared to 19% of men, privacy concerns by 32% of women compared to 21% of men, and environmental impact by 28% of women compared to 18% of men.
  - key: ai_usage.more_productive.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Only 16% of respondents disagreed that AI tools made them a lot more productive.

  - key: ai_usage.job_security_threat.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Only 19% of respondents saw AI as a threat to their job security.
  - key: ai_usage.ai_code_generation_frequency.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Developers who used AI more frequently tended to have less experience: the median was 10 years for those who never used it, compared to 6 years for those who used it constantly.

  # life_in_japan

  - key: life_in_japan.friend_group_balance.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Higher Japanese ability was linked to having more Japanese friends. Among respondents with no Japanese ability, 91% said their friend group was all or mostly non-Japanese. For those with business-level or fluent Japanese ability, that figure dropped to 44%.
  - key: life_in_japan.hobbies.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Even outside of work, respondents spent much of their time in front of a screen. Their top three hobbies were playing video games, programming, and watching movies or TV.
  - key: life_in_japan.initial_attraction.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Responses to this question varied by nationality. For American citizens, the top reason was an interest in the Japanese language. For Indian citizens, it was career opportunities. For Japanese citizens, it was family.
  - key: life_in_japan.life_japan_positive_aspects.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Convenience ranked highly as a positive aspect of Japan across all nationalities. American and Japanese citizens were more likely to value Japan’s health care, while Indian citizens focused on travel and adventure opportunities.
  - key: life_in_japan.life_japan_negative_aspects.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      The top negative aspect of life in Japan was the same across all nationalities: poor compensation. After that, non-Japanese citizens most often cited isolation and cultural barriers, while Japanese citizens were more likely to mention social pressure to conform.
  - key: life_in_japan.communities.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      Half of respondents said they weren’t active in any developer communities.

      Among those who were, members of TokyoDev’s Discord had a median compensation of ¥7.5 million, compared to ¥9.5 million for participants in TokyoDev’s in-person events. Discord members also had slightly less experience, with a median of 6 years, compared to 7 years for offline participants.

      # Insights from the 2025 TokyoDev Developer Survey

      Each year, TokyoDev runs a survey to better understand the experiences of international software developers in Japan. This year 989 people participated, up 21% from last year’s survey. These respondents answered 47 questions on topics such as compensation, working conditions, and AI. Following are some of our most important and surprising findings from the 2025 survey.

      ## Median compensation was 9.5 million yen

      All respondents had [a median compensation of 9.5 million](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#current_total_annual_compensation) yen, up 1 million yen from 2024\. The number of participants who reported that [their compensation had increased](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#income_evolution) since last year was 57%. Only 6% reported that it had decreased.

      Compensation correlated highly with [professional experience](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#years_of_experience). Respondents with less than one year of experience made a median of 2.8 million yen, while those with 20+ years of experience made a median of 14.6 million yen.

  - key: overview_2_international_companies.td2025
    t: |

      ## International companies still paid better, but the gap is narrowing

      [Respondents working at an international company](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#current_employer) without operations in Japan earned the most, with a median salary of 13.5 million yen. Next came respondents working at a Japanese subsidiary of an international company at 11.5 million yen, followed by companies headquartered in Japan at 8.5 million yen.

  - key: overview_3_japanese_companies_english_adoption.td2025
    t: |
      Since we first asked about employer type [in our 2020 survey](https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2020-developer-survey), the pay at Japanese companies has always been lower compared to that at international businesses. This gap [peaked in 2022](https://www.tokyodev.com/insights/2022-developer-survey#employer-type), with respondents working at Japanese subsidiaries earning 93% more than those at Japanese-headquartered companies. Since then, the gap has narrowed every successive year: [73% in 2023](https://2023.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/employer-info/#current_employer), [50% in 2024](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/employer-info/#current_employer), and finally 35% this year.

      During this period, the compensation of respondents at Japanese-headquartered companies only rose slightly, from 7.5 to 8.5 million yen. This means that the reduced salary gap is mostly the result of falling compensation rates at international subsidiaries.

      ## Japanese companies that adopt English have better practices

      Japanese companies [have told us](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/why-do-japanese-companies-hire-international-developers) that one advantage of hiring English speakers is that they are more up to date with the latest technologies and practices. Their belief was backed up by our survey results, which showed that a greater use of English at Japanese-headquartered companies correlated with a [higher rate of adoption of software engineering best practices](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/technology/#software_engineering_practices).

  - key: overview_4_greater_english_usage.td2025
    t: |

      For example, 70% of respondents who used English frequently or always said their employer used continuous integration, compared to 45% of those who rarely or never used English. Similarly, 63% of frequent English users worked at organizations with monitoring and logging, compared to 34% of infrequent users. For automated testing, the figures were 59% versus 28%, and for infrastructure as code, 49% versus 25%. The only practice more common among infrequent English users was waterfall development, used by 30% compared to 15% of frequent users.

      ## Greater English usage correlated with higher compensation

      The more respondents [used English](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#languages_used_colleagues_english), the higher their median compensation. Respondents who never used English had a median compensation of 5.5 million yen, whereas those who used it exclusively had a median of 10.5 million yen.

  - key: overview_5_english_professional_experience.td2025
    t: |
      These numbers partially reflect differences in professional experience. Those who never used English had a median of 4 years experience, whereas those who always used it had a median of 8 years.

  - key: overview_6_english_similar_experience.td2025
    t: |
      However, when comparing respondents with similar experience levels, those who used English more enjoyed better compensation than those who used it less.

  - key: overview_7_english_experienced_respondents.td2025
    t: |

      ## Experienced respondents used English more frequently

      Respondents with greater professional experience were more likely [to use English exclusively](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#languages_used_colleagues_english). Of those with 10+ years of experience, 74% used English only in the workplace, compared to 51% of those with 3 years or less.

  - key: overview_8_optional_remote_work.td2025
    t: |
      English-speaking developer jobs in Japan tend to be more attractive in terms of culture and compensation, but such opportunities are also rare and rather competitive, especially for junior candidates.

      ## Optional remote work decreased, but those who work remote were happier

      In a continuation of last year’s trend, more companies moved away from optional remote work and embraced hybrid work schedules. In 2024, [38% of respondents](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/work-environment/#remote_work_policy) could decide for themselves if they wanted to work remotely; in 2025, [that number fell to 32%](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#remote_work_policy). Hybrid work schedules, by contrast, rose from 37% to 43% this year.

  - key: overview_9_remote_work_happiness.td2025
    t: |
      Respondents at organizations that permit remote work were [happier with their job](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#job_happiness). On a scale of 1-5, those who could work fully remotely had an average happiness score of 3.8, compared to 2.9 for respondents who could never work remotely. Those in hybrid work environments scored an average of 3.4.

  - key: overview_10_remote_work_searching_for_job.td2025
    t: |
      Not only were respondents who had to work from an office less happy, but they were also [more likely to be looking for a job](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#searching_for_job): 42% of them were actively job-hunting, compared to only 20% of those in fully remote environments.

  - key: overview_11_views_on_life_in_japan.td2025
    t: |
      The negativity associated with in-office mandates may be less about the value of remote work in and of itself, and  more that such companies tend to be worse places to work overall. For instance, when respondents could choose whether to work fully remotely or not, [45% of respondents still chose to go into the office regularly](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#regular_work_location). Those who did go in were also less likely to be looking for a new job, at a rate of 12%, compared to 17% of those who worked regularly from a dedicated home office.

      ## Views on life in Japan were shaped by nationality

      Participants had different [reasons for initially coming to Japan](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/life-in-japan/#initial_attraction), largely dependent on their nationality. For instance, 75% of Indian respondents indicated that they’d come to Japan for career opportunities. On the other hand, only 16% of American respondents said the same. Instead, 54% of Americans listed their interest in the Japanese language as their primary motivation. Meanwhile, 62% of those with Japanese citizenship came because of family connections in Japan or the desire to explore their Japanese ancestry.

      Residents of Japan, regardless of nationality, considered “convenience” one of Japan’s greatest benefits. However, some aspects of Japan were rated highly by certain nationalities and not others. For instance, 38% of Americans and 47% of Japanese rated healthcare as being one of the top [positive aspects of living here](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/life-in-japan/#life_japan_positive_aspects), but for people of other nationalities, only 16% indicated that Japanese healthcare was a major benefit.

      The top [negative aspect of life in Japan](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/life-in-japan/#life_japan_negative_aspects) was the same across all nationalities: poor compensation. After that, non-Japanese citizens most often cited isolation and cultural barriers as problematic, while Japanese citizens were more likely to mention social pressure to conform.

      ## AI usage was widespread, but dropped with experience

      When we asked who used AI tools, 94% of respondents said they did regularly. The [most popular use cases](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/ai-usage/#ai_uses) were code generation, learning and research, and translation. Many used it very regularly: 33% of respondents generated [at least half the code they produced](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/ai-usage/#ai_generated_code_balance) through AI, and 38% of respondents [were using it daily](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/ai-usage/#ai_code_generation_frequency).

      More experienced respondents used AI less frequently. The median experience was 10 years for those who never used it, compared to 6 years for those who used it constantly. It’s possible that the responsibilities of more experienced respondents are in general less suited to AI, as those who strongly disagreed that AI had made them more productive had a median of 8.5 years of experience, compared to 6 years for those who strongly agreed.

      ## The gender gap widened with experience

      Of our respondents, 87% were men and 12% were women. Because only 1% of respondents didn’t fit into those categories, we didn’t have enough data to perform further analyses on them.

      Generally, we found little variation between the responses from men and women. For instance, there was no significant difference in their employment status, their happiness with their job, whether they worked for a Japanese-headquartered company or not, the industry they worked in, or the size of their employer.

      In other areas, however, there were noteworthy differences. For instance, [women respondents tended to be less experienced than men](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#gender), with a median of 6 years of professional experience compared to 8 years for men. They were [more likely to live in Tokyo](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#country): 69% of them lived there compared to 58% of men. They were [more likely to be coding bootcamp grads](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#professional_qualifications) as well, at a rate of 21% compared to 10% for men.

      Women were also [significantly more concerned](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/ai-usage/#ai_generated_code_balance) about AI’s broader ramifications, with 36% of women citing ethical considerations compared to 19% of men, 32% worried about privacy compared to 21% of men, and 28% concerned about its impact on the environment compared to 18% of men.

      Women respondents were far more likely [to have experienced gender-based discrimination](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/current-job/#discrimination_issues) in the workplace, with 31% of women reporting it compared to 2% of men.

      Overall, [the median compensation of men respondents was 27% higher](https://2025.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#gender) than that of women respondents. However, when analyzing respondents by experience level and gender, women who had 7 or fewer years of experience actually had a median compensation 1 million yen higher than men’s. For more experienced women, though, the gap was reversed and considerably wider. Among those with 7–9 years experience, men earned 2.5 million yen more than women. For those with 10 or more years of experience, men earned 5 million yen more.

      The fact that women make up such a small percentage of engineering teams contributes to the challenges they face. If you’d like to help change this, see [A Four-Stage Approach for Hiring Women on Your Engineering Team](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/hiring-women-on-your-engineering-team).
