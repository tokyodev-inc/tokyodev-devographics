      Have you ever wondered how much the average developer earns in Japan? How common remote work really is? Or what people actually like best about the country?

      In order to answer these questions –and many more– we've now been running the TokyoDev Developer Survey for seven years in a row. And as the tech ecosystem is evolving, so does the survey. 

      This year we've added a new section to help track how widespread AI usage really is; as well as more questions about your experience living in Japan. 

      Over 800 respondents answered [last year's TokyoDev Developer Survey](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/), and we're hoping to do even better this year!

      The survey is anonymous, and we will only release aggregated data to avoid disclosing any personal information. The more responses we get, the more interesting insights we’ll be able to share, so please help out by answering the survey and sharing it with your peers!
