      Ever wondered how much the average developer in Japan earns? How common remote work really is? Or what people love most about living here?

      For the past seven years, we’ve been running the TokyoDev Developer Survey to answer these questions and many more. Last year, [over 800 developers took part](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/), and this year we’re expanding the survey with a section on AI to see how widespread its use really is, along with new questions about life in Japan.

      The survey is anonymous, and we’ll only share aggregated results, never personal data. The more responses we get, the better the insights, so please take a few minutes to answer the survey and share it with your peers.
