      The community of international developers in Japan is small, so every response counts. Last year 814 developers filled it out. This year we’re aiming for 1,000 so we can unlock new insights while still protecting the anonymity of everyone who participates.

      Unlike last year's survey, this year the question above let respondents select “None of the above” as an option instead of having to skip the question altogether.

      The year-over-year decline shown here is almost certainly due to this increase in total question participation, and not to any real-world trend.

      Ever wondered how much the average developer in Japan earns? How common remote work really is? Or what people love most about living here?

      For the past seven years, we’ve been running the TokyoDev Developer Survey to answer these questions and many more. Last year, [over 800 developers took part](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/), and this year we’re expanding the survey with a section on AI to see how widespread its use really is, along with new questions about life in Japan.

      The survey is anonymous, and we’ll only share aggregated results, never personal data. The more responses we get, the better the insights, so please take a few minutes to answer the survey and share it with your peers.

      Welcome to the 2025 TokyoDev survey! It should take about 10 minutes to complete.

  - key: user_info.japan_province.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      78% of respondents lived in the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa), [down 2%](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/#japan_province) from last year.

      Respondents in Aichi and Kyoto had a median compensation of ¥4.5 million, which was approximately half of the median compensation of those living in the Greater Tokyo Area.
  - key: user_info.residency_status.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      60% of respondents had a residency status tied to their employer (engineer or highly skilled foreign professional).
  - key: user_info.country.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      The respondents were quite diverse, holding citizenships from 81 countries or regions.
  - key: user_info.age.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      80% of respondents were between 20 and 39 years old.
  - key: user_info.relationship_status.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      73% of respondents were in some sort of relationship.
  - key: user_info.number_of_kids.takeaway.td2025
    t: |
      While 71% of respondents had no children, among those who were married that dropped to 47%.
  - key: user_info.gender.takeaway.td2024
    t: |
      Male respondents had more experience than female respondents. While men had a median of 8 years of professional experience, women had 6 years. Furthermore, men had a 75th percentile of 12 years of experience compared to 9 for women.

      This partially explains why the median compensation of male respondents was 27% higher than women respondents. Among respondents who have less than seven years of experience, women actually had a median compensation that was ¥1 million higher than men. However, among those with 7-9 years experience, men earned ¥2.5 million more than women, and among those with 10 or more years of experience, men earned ¥5 million more.

      The reasons behind this disparity are complex, but it's clear that women face challenges in the Japanese tech industry. For ideas on concrete action your company can take on this, please see [this article](https://www.tokyodev.com/articles/hiring-women-on-your-engineering-team).

This trend has been driven by respondents at subsidiaries having a lower median compensation while that of respondents at Japanese headquartered companies remains stable.
