      The community of international developers in Japan is small, so every response counts. Last year 814 developers filled it out. This year we’re aiming for 1,000 so we can unlock new insights while still protecting the anonymity of everyone who participates.

      Unlike last year's survey, this year the question above let respondents select “None of the above” as an option instead of having to skip the question altogether. 

      The year-over-year decline shown here is almost certainly due to this increase in total question participation, and not to any real-world trend.

      Ever wondered how much the average developer in Japan earns? How common remote work really is? Or what people love most about living here?

      For the past seven years, we’ve been running the TokyoDev Developer Survey to answer these questions and many more. Last year, [over 800 developers took part](https://2024.surveys.tokyodev.com/en-US/demographics/), and this year we’re expanding the survey with a section on AI to see how widespread its use really is, along with new questions about life in Japan.

      The survey is anonymous, and we’ll only share aggregated results, never personal data. The more responses we get, the better the insights, so please take a few minutes to answer the survey and share it with your peers.
